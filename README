Quick Start:
------------
The quickest and easiest way to get HackedBox up and running is to run the
following commands:

# cd HackedBox-0.7.x
# ./configure
# make
# su -c 'make install'

This will configure, compile and install HackedBox the quickest.  For those
who like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading ./configure --help, some
compile time options can be turned on and off before the build.

For general information on GNU's ./configure, see the file INSTALL.


Configuring HackedBox:
---------------------
The next thing most users want to do after installing HackedBox is to configure
the colors, fonts, menus, etc. to their liking.  This is covered by the files
data/README, data/README.menu and data/README.style.  These files give
detailed information on how to customize your new window manager.


Included utilities:
-------------------
Currently, the only included utilities are a program named bsetroot and a
script called bsetbg. bsetroot is a replacement for xsetroot, minus a few
options.  The difference between xsetroot and bsetroot is that bsetroot has
been coded for multiple screens (e.g. multi-headed displays), where as the
stock xsetroot is not. The bsetbg script acts as a wrapper for most of the
popular programs used to set background pixmaps, making it possible
for styles to provide a machine-independent rootCommand.
