The data/ directory holds some menu and style (or theme) examples for Hackedbox.

The styles are installed as system defaults, and are ALWAYS overwritten when
upgrading or otherwise re-installing Hackedbox.  Changes to them are
discouraged, because of this reason.

In the data/ directory, you will find a directory named `styles.'  These are
the system defaults that are installed when Hackedbox is built, and they are
intended as examples on how to customize and control the appearance of Hackedbox.
In the event that a user does not have a defined style, Hackedbox falls back on
the example styles included here.

Also in the data/ directory is a file named `menu'.  This is meant as an
example but is also installed if make install detects that no menu exists.
If hackedbox is ever started without a valid menu the user will get a backup
menu which gives the ability to launch and xterm and exit the window manager.

For information on creating/editing a menu, see the file README.menu.

For information on creating/editing a style, see the file README.style.
