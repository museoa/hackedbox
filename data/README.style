Creating a new style (aka "theme"):
-----------------------------------
After getting Hackedbox up and running, the next thing you want to do is change
the colors/fonts/etc. on the screen.  Hackedbox uses a "style" to read its
configuration information.  A style in Hackedbox consists of X resources placed
in a file.  Just like the menu file (see README.menu), the style file can be
put anywhere on the filesystem; as long as you have read access to the file,
Hackedbox can use it.

First, we need to decide where to put our style file, and what to name it.
I recommend using the naming scheme described on http://themes.org/
when creating styles.

Let's get started.  Let's put our new style into a file named `results.'
Following the themes.org naming scheme, this file will go into
.hackedbox/styles.  Same as with the menu file, we use our favorite text editor
to create the new style.

X resources consist of a key and a value.  The key is constructed of several
smaller keys, delimited by a period (`.').  Keys may also contain a star (`*')
to serve as a wildcard, which means that one line of typed text will match
several keys.  This is useful for styles that are based on one or two colors.

Hackedbox allows you to configure it's two main components:  the
menus and the window decorations.  Lets begin by creating a style for our
toolbar.

First we need to define a "texture" for the toolbar and it's components.
Textures tell Hackedbox how to mold or shape the colors we supply.

A texture is comprised of the following elements:

	Raised / Sunken / Flat		give the component a raised, sunken
					or flat appearance (respectively)

	Solid / Gradient		tell Hackedbox whether to draw a solid
					or gradiented texture

	Interlaced			tells Hackedbox to interlace a
					gradient (and gradient ONLY) texture

	Bevel1 / Bevel2			tells Hackedbox which type of bevel
					to use.

NOTE on Bevel1 / Bevel2:

Bevel1 is the default bevel.  The shading is placed on the edge of the image.
Bevel2 is an alternative.  The shading is placed one pixel in from the edge
of the image.

NOTE: the texture strings don't have to be capitalized like they did in
previous versions.  They are still placed in capitals here, because things like
the bbtools still use the old method.

We define colors for the textures.  Colors can be any valid X colorname
(from the RGB database) or it can be a color specifier, as described by
'man 1 X.'

All textures have a color and a colorTo key.  These keys
are required for gradient images.  For solids, only color is needed.
Not all textures have a text color, just certain base textures.

Next, let's move onto the menus.  Since Hackedbox was written in C++, all of
the menus used in it are subclasses of one generic base class.  Hackedbox reads
the style for the configuration for that base class, which applies to all
the menus used in Hackedbox.

The menu has two main parts, the title and the frame.  There is nothing
visible under them, so we only configure these two components.  The menu frame
and menu title BOTH have a configurable text color, and the menu frame has a
highlight color and the corresponding highlighted text color key. Let's assign
some textures and colors to our menu, and see what our style file looks like
so far:

...
menu.title:                     Raised Diagonal Interlaced Gradient Bevel1
menu.frame:                     Raised Diagonal Gradient Bevel1

menu.title.color:               grey20
menu.title.colorTo:             rgb:8/8/7
menu.title.textColor:           grey85
menu.frame.color:               rgb:8/8/7
menu.frame.colorTo:             grey10
menu.frame.textColor:           white
menu.frame.highlightColor:      grey85
menu.frame.hiTextColor:         grey20
...

Next, we need to configure our windows.  Windows are like buttons, they have
two states, focused and unfocused.  There for we define a separate texture
for unfocused windows and focused windows.  The buttons on the titlebar
are focus dependant also, so we need to configure them as well.  The buttons
only have one "pressed" state, so we only have to define that once, instead of
having a focus.pressed state and an unfocus.pressed state.  The window frame
is the thin border around the client window. Let's be sure to catch it as well.

After adding the window config, our style now looks like this:

...
menu.title:                     Raised Diagonal Interlaced Gradient Bevel1
menu.frame:                     Raised Diagonal Gradient Bevel1

menu.title.color:               grey20
menu.title.colorTo:             rgb:8/8/7
menu.title.textColor:           grey85
menu.frame.color:               rgb:8/8/7
menu.frame.colorTo:             grey10
menu.frame.textColor:           white
menu.frame.highlightColor:      grey85
menu.frame.hiTextColor:         grey20

window.focus:                   Raised Diagonal Interlaced Gradient Bevel1
window.focus.button:            Raised Diagonal Gradient Bevel1
window.unfocus:                 Raised Diagonal Gradient Bevel1
window.unfocus.button:          Sunken Diagonal Gradient Bevel1
window.button.pressed:          Flat Diagonal Interlaced Gradient
window.frame:                   Raised Solid Bevel1

window.focus.color:             grey
window.focus.colorTo:           grey20
window.focus.textColor:         grey85
window.focus.button.color:      grey
window.focus.button.colorTo:    grey20
window.unfocus.color:           rgb:8/8/7
window.unfocus.colorTo:         grey20
window.unfocus.textColor:       grey
window.unfocus.button.color:    grey20
window.unfocus.button.colorTo:  grey
window.button.pressed.color:    rgb:4/4/38
window.button.pressed.colorTo:  rgb:f/f/d
window.frame.color:             grey85
...

Now all we have to do is finish off the style with a few miscellanous options.
These include the title and menu fonts/justification, border color, bevel and
handle widths, window move style and the root command.

Fonts must be a valid X11 font screen, or a valid font alias.  Use a utility
like `xfontsel' (and others) to preview fonts.  Also use the utility
`xlsfonts' to spit out all the current X font names and aliases stored in
the X server.

Justification can be one of three things:  LeftJustify, CenterJustify or
RightJustify.

The border color is the color applied to the 1 pixel border around the menu
frame/title and the window titlebar/buttons/handle/etc.  Setting this color
can have drastic effects on your style, so don't just leave it set to `black'
all the time.  ;)

The bevel and handle widths control the size and spacing of decorations in
Hackedbox.  The larger the number, the more space Hackedbox takes up.

The window move style tells Hackedbox how to move windows when you drag them
with your mouse.  There are two options for it: Opaque or Wire.

The root command is the command run every time the style is loaded (either at
startup or after a reconfigure/style-change).  It is used to run a program
like xv, Esetroot, wmsetbg, etc. to set an image/color/pattern on the root
window.  Just supply a command and it will be run.

Also, as a note, an X resource file can have comments.  Precede the line with
and exclamation mark `!' and the rest of the line will be ignored.

Let's finish off the details and take a look at our finished style:

...

Alright!  Our style is finished.  Let's see how the sucker looks.  First we
need to tell Hackedbox to use the new style.  The way to do that is to edit
your menu (refer to README.menu for this) and add:

[style] (Results) {~/.hackedbox/styles/results}

somewhere in our menu.  Taking advantage of Hackedbox' automagic menu updates,
all we have to do is close and reopen the root menu and our new style entry
will be visible.  Select it and Hackedbox will apply the new style we just
created.
